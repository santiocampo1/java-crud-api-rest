## 📚 Overview

This project is a practice exercise to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in Java using modern technologies and best practices. It serves as a learning playground for building a RESTful API with a robust tech stack.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language
- **Spring Boot**: For creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build automation tool
- **Hibernate**: Object-relational mapping tool for database operations
- **PostgreSQL**: Open-source relational database

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Implement CRUD operations via RESTful API endpoints
- Practice Spring Boot application setup and configuration
- Gain hands-on experience with Hibernate for ORM
- Learn database integration using PostgreSQL
- Understand the basics of building a scalable backend service

## 🌟 Features

- RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations
- Data persistence using PostgreSQL
- Object-Relational Mapping with Hibernate
- Dependency management with Maven
- Modular and maintainable code structure
